# Hackernews Bolt

## Overview
This bolt provides basic integration with the Hackernews API. The api itself is not very robust and
is a little unusual when it comes to standard apis. The data that Hackernews exposes is basically just 
a dump of their in-memory data structures into a firebase firestore database, more info 
[here](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

## Contextual Information (Definitions)
- Collection: A list or array of one of the core types of content that hackernews' api returns.
I.e a list of `topstories`, `newstories`, `beststories`, `askstories`, `showstories`, `jobstories`.
For more information including how objects are structured in Hackernews's API please see 
their [API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). for more information

## Local Development
To build and run with the Hackernews Bolt active, go through the DialogFlow and Slack setup make sure you have an active benten slack bot running.
Then run the following commands.
 
1. `cd ~/dev/benten/hackernews-bolt;`
2. `mvn clean install`
3. `cd ~/dev/benten/benten-starter;`
5. `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`
6. `mvn spring-boot:run;`

If you get an error about the `benten-hackernews-bolt` not being found, try running this:

`cd ~/dev/benten/benten-hackernews-bolt/; mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/Users/jleveroni/dev/benten/benten-hackernews-bolt/target/benten-hackernews-bolt-0.1.5.jar -DgroupId=benten-hackernews-bolt -DartifactId=benten-hackernews-bolt -Dversion=0.1.5 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true;`

*Note: im not sure if building and installing the `benten-hackernews-bolt` is necessary. I am not very familiar with java and its package management.
I did this because when i ran the starter project it could not find the hackernews bolt package since
it was not installed in my local ~/.m2 folder. If there is a way to fix this please update the readme and
project accordingly. 

## Testing
Initially tests has been provided for every public method exposed in the Hackernews Bolt. If Hackernews
alters their api and you choose to extend/alter the functionality of this bolt, please make sure to 
include tests for all public methods you change or add. To run the tests for this bolt use the following
commands, they will run all tests under the `/benten/benten-hackernews-bolt/src/test` folder.

1. `cd ~/dev/benten/hackernews-bolt;`
2. `mvn clean install;`

## Integrating Hackernews Bolt Into Your Project
To add the hackernews bolt to your project add the following to your pom file under the <dependencies> tag:

Maven:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>benten-hackernews-bolt</groupId>
        <artifactId>benten-hackernews-bolt</artifactId>
        <version>${benten.version}</version>
    </dependency>

Gradle:

    TODO <insert gradle equivalent here>


In the benten.properties file you need to be sure that the following properties are defined:

    # Dialogflow api token
    benten.ai.token=<your-dialogflow-token>
    
    # Slack bot token
    benten.slack.token=<your-slack-token>
    
    # Benten Hacker News configuration
    benten.hackernews.baseUrl=https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com
    benten.hackernews.apiVersion=v0
    
Your application should now support the actions listed below when they are sent from DialogFlow.

#### Parameter Explanation

There are 3 parameters to all of the listed queries above, `resultSetSize`, `offset`, `startIndex`.
All of these parameters have default values so if you do not specify values for any of them they will 
default to `10`, `0`, and `0` respectively. Note that the calculations for determining the result of a
collection query depend on either `offset` or `startIndex` being defined, because of this the values are defaulted.
If you do not provide both parameters, the calculations will be based off the provided `resultSetSize` (or default value of `10`)
and an `offset` of `0`. The usages for `offset` or `startIndex` are explained more in depth in the following sections.

_resultSetSize_

The `resultSetSize` represents the number of items you wish to be returned when you query a collection.
For example, say you want the latest 13 "stories" from Hackernews. To achieve this you would want
to send the `benten-hackernews-bolt` an action with a name of `action_hackernews_get_new_stories` 
and a parameter of `resultSetSize` that is equal to `13`, and `offset` of 0. If no `resultSetSize` parameter
is specified it will default to `10`. **IMPORTANT** `resultSetSize` is currently also limited to 25 as its
maximum value due to the structure of the hackernews API and the use of multi-threading.

_offset_

The `offset` represents the offset from the latest content in units of whatever the `limit` is set to.
For example, say out of the last 100 `beststories` on Hackernews you want to retrieve the stories 
between `40 - 60`. You would send a `action_hackernews_get_new_stories` action with a `resultSetSize` 
of `20` and an `offset` of `2`. 

Calculations:

    startIndex = ((offset` * resultSetSize)     // Evaluation (2 * 20) + 1     = 41
    endIndex =  startIndex` + `resultSetSize    // Evaluation 40 + 20          = 60
    resultSetIndexRange = [41, 60)
    
The set of stories returned is exclusive of the min boundary and inclusive of the max i.e. 
`[startIndex, endIndex)`.

Note if the calculated `(startIndex + endIndex) - 1` is greater than the length of the array of ids
returned by the Hackernews API you will get an error, (API usually returns between 400 and 500 (max) ids).

_startIndex_

Say you want to get more granular control over the result set size of a Hackernews collection query. 
This is where `startIndex` comes in. Let's say you want to query from the last 100 stories starting 
at index 17 and you only want 3 results. This would not be possible using `offset` as you could 
specify offset of 0 but that would still give you the results 17 - 26. In this scenario you should
not supply a value for `offset` and instead supply a value of `17` to the `startIndex` parameter
and a value of `3` to the `resultSetSize`. This will give you the result set of the latest stories
starting at the 17th last story through the last 19th story.

This gives you more granular control over your search results. However remember that `offset` always 
takes precedence over `startIndex` so if you want to use `startIndex` make sure to not set the 
`offset` parameter.
